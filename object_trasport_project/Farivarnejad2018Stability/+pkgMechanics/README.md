A package for simple mechanic instances, like mass point and rigid body.

## modified 27-03-2019

1. Add class `BodyConfig` as a general tool for all classes (support 0 or 2 input arguments).
2. Change the class names as `MassPointPlanar` and `RigidBodyPlanar` to specify the dimension of inputs.

## modified 28-03-2019

1. Finish the basic properties and methods of `MassPointPlanar` and `RigidBodyPlanar`.
2. Add some useful tool functions to the package.
3. Test `MassPointPlanar` and `RigidBodyPlanar` with example files `test_masspoint.m` and `test_rigidbody.m`. The force input comes from keyboard, which requires the [Hebi package](<https://github.com/HebiRobotics/MatlabInput>).
